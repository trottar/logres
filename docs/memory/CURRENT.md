# Current State

## Active Objective
Modularize proven Logres UI incrementally with D-046 fixture/model/view parity before all-NPC expansion. **Do not alter accepted camera or DynamicCam behavior.** Preserve existing quests, native controls, restoration and rendering during extraction; defer bank/auction feasibility until after reuse is proven.

## Current Work Item
**P0262 N2 — NARRATIVE PAGINATION VIEW EXTRACTION (PREPARED / IN-GAME UNVERIFIED).** GitHub `main` `b439d4f` verifies P0261 pushed; user reports existing and new P-tab previews work as expected (scoped visual acceptance). Extract the exact page-splitting logic, page-indicator placement/appearance, and body page text into `UI/NarrativePages.lua`; existing `QuestDialogue` remains the session/action owner and the only frame factory. No new UI, gameplay actions or camera modifications. After push, validate all five page-1 previews, pagination, panel-internal actions, and camera unchanged. N3 decision visual extraction only after validation.

## Verified State
- **P0261 PUSHED / SCOPED VISUAL PASS:** verified `main` `b439d4f`; user confirms previews work as expected. Does not establish live gossip, choice claiming, or unobserved quest transitions. P0261 earlier R0/R1/R2 checker/guard failures remain preserved in evidence.
- **P0262 N2 PREPARED / IN-GAME UNVERIFIED:** shared page builder, pager rail painter and body text painter; no new interactive ownership, no camera changes. R0 failed the prewrite P0255 layout checker because geometry had moved; R1 updates that checker to inspect the same real painter, without weakening coordinates or guards. Needs visual and runtime regression validation.
- **P0260 PUSHED / SOURCE AUDIT COMPLETE:** GitHub `main` `1251434` verified; 54 provisional NPC interaction variants and coupled UI boundaries mapped. No runtime changes; camera preserved. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0260_MODULARITY_SOURCE_AUDIT.md`.
- **P0261 N1 PREPARED / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED:** source-independent narrative/decision presentation model maps guarded live offer and authored long/short/generic fixtures to the same production `QuestDialogue:PresentText` renderer. Two new P-tab buttons. Preview controls inert, generic gossip not live-integrated.
- **P0258 PUSHED / PREVIEW VISUAL ACCEPTED (SCOPED):** `edec5eb`; user accepted Multiple reward preview, not real choice/claim. Earlier P0256 P-tab gallery and P0257 model/gallery work are pushed; universal element preview coverage remains incomplete.
- **Live NPC quest ownership remains bounded:** scoped Accept/Decline and no-choice completion control exist; player-triggered reward selection, full gossip, Continue and complex services are NOT accepted as Logres-owned. Maintain usable Blizzard controls and native restoration. Quest 237 is reserved.
- **OPEN / DEFERRED negative evidence:** P0257 R0 duplicated layout geometry and failed P0254 checker; R1 failed its own generated-source preview-model assertion; R2 corrected static checks. P0251 R2 immersion restore failed before R3 acceptance. P0248 preview failed due to a nil reward renderer method before P0249 repair. Reward item availability had intermittent failures. These results remain in their original evidence records; no new run reclassifies them as PASS.
- **OPEN runtime issues:** native Blizzard-frame flash during actual completion claim; real multi-choice/claim unverified; unspecified issues from the user's gameplay session remain DETAILS PENDING; quest 237 must not be completed solely to validate this patch.
- **FROZEN CAMERA:** existing camera/DynamicCam framing, transitions, event subscriptions, coexistence and zoom behavior are accepted and unchanged by P0261.

## Next Action
Apply P0261 N1 from verified `1251434` baseline; run full shadow/postwrite checker suite, stage/commit/push and verify GitHub main. Deploy runtime and inspect P — Previews: existing **Quest Dialogue Preview**, **NPC Narrative: Short**, **NPC Dialogue: Generic**, **Reward Preview: Single/Multiple**. The long and reward presentations must remain visually unchanged; generic is a text-only sample without fake options. Check a naturally available live quest offer only if convenient; native Accept/Decline fallback and Immersion OFF/ON must remain safe. Camera must behave exactly as before. If no natural quest is available, defer the live sample rather than invent PASS. After acceptance, narrow N2 extraction of actual narrative paging/renderer code; no speculative services or camera coordination changes.

## Success Criteria
P0260 succeeds as a **docs-only source audit** when the full static checker suite and `git diff --check` pass and its evidence distinguishes observed reuse, coupling, proposed extraction, and unproved Forever service capabilities. **Zero changes to any Lua/TOC/camera source.** Later modularity code patches require one shared renderer for preview/live, no regression in accepted quest visuals/claims, fail-open native UI, protected/secret safety, and **unchanged working camera behavior**; unavailable runtime proof is DEFERRED, not PASS.

## Do Not Reopen Without New Evidence
Do not infer addon installation from one guessed filesystem path or the presence/absence of a Lua global alone. No hard QuestieDB dependency, package bundling, unknown CurseForge project ID, global quest ID scans on updates, guessed quest availability, invented coordinates or native pin scraping. Do not hide the Blizzard minimap, alter user-accepted waypoint/focused-quest bearings, or treat missing locations as PASS. Baked flavor must not be guessed from a Source-only indicator. Keep negative and deferred evidence explicit.
