# Current State

## Active Objective
Phase H.3: make Logres's own compass the usable dynamic nearby-navigation surface. The native minimap is HIDDEN during normal immersion and is NOT a visible fallback for missing Logres markers. P0223 accepted focused-quest/waypoint bearings remain preserved. Additional nearby quest-giver, services, and live tracking POI coverage is still OPEN.

## Current Work Item
Verified P0235 pushed `5c77b1e`; latest 0.0.138-dev loadCount 310 gives `compass nearby ready 1/1`, `compass services ready 1/1`, base compasscheck PASS, and user visually found flight master/innkeeper/repair. User also reports historical quest NPCs without current quest availability and no local POI distance scaling. P0236 prepares **all provider-supported service-flag categories** (including vendor/trainer/banker/auction/stable and more) without reading minimap tracking preferences, keeps independent quest and service qualification, radius 50 yards, one category per NPC, per-type bounded cache and at most 32 service glyphs in the finite viewport. Adds distance-dependent size to ordinary nearby POIs/services/tracking vignettes, not focused quest or manual waypoint. No claim of active services, current quest offers, minimap herb/ore blips, or universal map coverage. Filter UI deferred until the user inspects these categories. **Runtime not tested until deployed.** Evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0236_POI_COVERAGE_AND_PROXIMITY_TEST.md`.

## Verified State
- **P0235 live result**: user saw flight masters, innkeepers and repair services with different colors; 0.0.138-dev loadCount 310 `compass nearby ready candidates=1 shown=1`, `compass services ready candidates=1 shown=1`, compasscheck PASS. Distinct categories observed by user over movement, not simultaneous count. P0236 follow-up fixes breadth/size; historical quest starts still not current offers.
- **User-identified P0235 classification gap (2026-10-17):** flight masters may be shown as possible quest givers only if they have any historical quest start, while service-only flight masters and innkeepers are missing entirely. Confirmed by inspecting `QuestieDBNearby:ScanChunk` quest-only spawn gate; this is a feature coverage FAIL in P0234, not proof service NPCs are absent. P0235 adds service-only support but remains live UNVERIFIED. Evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0235_INDEPENDENT_SERVICE_ROLES.md`.
- **P0233 runtime evidence (load 307):** `compasscheck` without preceding `questiedbprobe` in this load reports `provider=ready candidates=4 shown=2`. User-followed glyph reached a real quest giver; one physical path validated. Exact NPC identity, eligibility, broad map coverage, and all service/tracking markers not established. See P0233 evidence.
- **P0231 new runtime proof (0.0.137-dev loadCount 306):** QuestieDB 1.0.6 loaded Forever baked contract-compatible; nearby `index=ready map=1432 area=38 scanned=13392 ids=13392 zoneNPCs=153 questNPCs=30 spawns=38 nearby=5 radius=50 truncated=false`; canonical map trace `requested=1432 chain=1432 entries=54 failure=- trigger=panel-map-diagnostic`; Compass Check `provider=ready candidates=4 shown=2`. This establishes in-game indexing and addon-owned marker show state **after manual panel retry**. Autonomous startup, general map coverage, visual accuracy and eligible quest offers remain unverified. Evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0232_P0231_RUNTIME_NEARBY_EVIDENCE.md`.
- **P0230 FAIL, new 0.0.136-dev runtime evidence**: loadCount 305, QuestieDB v1.0.6 compatible, near index `map-not-in-provider-zone-table`, `map=- area=- scanned=0 ids=0`, compass `candidates=0 shown=0`. Native compasscheck PASS checks heading/waypoint policy, not nearby glyphs. A missing map mapping aborts index before positions are read; no evidence of zero nearby NPCs. No new Lua error is recorded by these panel lines, but a full WoW Lua/taint log was not provided. See P0231 evidence.
- **P0228 runtime provider PASS, newly observed**: uploaded 0.0.135-dev diagnostics loadCount 304 show QuestieDB registered=yes loaded=yes tocVersion=1.0.6 tocFlavor=Forever tocMode=baked contract=1 mode=baked provider=contract-compatible in two panel runs. Quest location/gossip remains DEFERRED; no compass glyph results were part of P0228.
- **P0230 scope corrections**: discarded hardcoded Loch Modan-only suggestion; use dynamic current-zone mapping and 50-yard candidate radius. The user reports the Blizzard minimap is HIDDEN during normal immersion: it must NOT be used as the visible fallback to justify missing compass features. Database-only spawns never establish quest availability.

- P0229 process correction: user reported QuestieDB visible in WoW; prior `not-installed` claim inferred absence from one path and old loadCount 300 diagnostics despite loadCount 302. The first P0228 applier failed pre-write `CURRENT.md` EOF hygiene, then R1 repaired the generator. The existing developer panel already offers **E — Compass and Navigation → QuestieDB Location Probe** (fifth action); open with `/logres panel`. The assistant omitted these steps and repeatedly requested unchanged diagnostics. This is documented assistant failure, not proof that QuestieDB is absent or that any new glyphs should appear. P0228 runtime remains UNVERIFIED. Evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0229_QUESTIEDB_DIAGNOSTIC_HANDOFF_FAILURE.md`.
- GitHub main P0227 `7c6850b` verified. Existing waypoint and focused accepted quest direction are P0223 user-accepted. Additional native POI feeds remain empty in tested Loch Modan environment; additional POI glyphs remain OPEN.
- P0226 0.0.134-dev last recorded `provider=not-installed` meant unavailable `_G.LibQuestieDB` in that run; it does **not** prove absent installation or failure of newer load count 302. Prior lack of proper state separation is an integration defect.
- `Questie/QuestieDB` v1.0.6 Source `ModeIndicator.GetStatus().expansion` is nil for Baked; generated baked TOC declares `X-Flavor: Forever`; Questie checks `RequireContract`, PlateSmith optional companion uses `OptionalDeps: QuestieDB`. Those are source findings, not yet new WoW runtime proof.
- QuestieDB remains optional for Logres as a whole; third-party data may miss hidden, patch-specific and phased quests. Redistribution/license unresolved; do not bundle it or claim CurseForge-managed dependency.

## Next Action
Apply P0236 guarded runtime code and deploy to Forever beta; use developer panel E — Compass and Navigation → Compass Check (read-only) before QuestieDB Location Probe (one-shot index retry), then visually compare categories and size while moving normally. Confirm no Lua/taint/protected errors. If valid, plan opt-in filters by category and refine quest eligibility rather than calling historical starts current quests.

## Success Criteria
P0235 source and local visible service categories remain historical evidence, not universal. P0236 must show `Logres compass POI proximity` nonzero sized and scale variations across distances; provider source `questiedbservicecoverage` must report supported categories on contract 4. Historical quest-giver noise remains OPEN; all new service markers remain *possible*. Native heading/focused quest/manual waypoint, hidden-minimap ownership, optional QuestieDB and radius 50 stay unchanged. Runtime deployment and checks required.

## Do Not Reopen Without New Evidence
Do not infer addon installation from one guessed filesystem path or the presence/absence of a Lua global alone. No hard QuestieDB dependency, package bundling, unknown CurseForge project ID, global quest ID scans on updates, guessed quest availability, invented coordinates or native pin scraping. Do not hide the Blizzard minimap, alter user-accepted waypoint/focused-quest bearings, or treat missing locations as PASS. Baked flavor must not be guessed from a Source-only indicator. Keep negative and deferred evidence explicit.
