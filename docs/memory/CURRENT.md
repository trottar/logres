# Current State

## Active Objective
Modularize proven Logres UI incrementally with D-046 fixture/model/view parity before all-NPC expansion. **Do not alter accepted camera or DynamicCam behavior.** Preserve existing quests, native controls, restoration and rendering during extraction; defer bank/auction feasibility until after reuse is proven.

## Current Work Item
**P0265 N5 — COMBINED INTERACTIVE NPC OPTIONS (PREPARED / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED).** Verified main `6b3ed96` contains P0264. The user confirms reward-choice switching, reset and preview-only completion behavior; newest `0.0.162-dev` diagnostic export shows eight preview clicks, quest and offer checks PASS, with no native actions. User explicitly rejects more one-feature patches. P0265 delivers four NPC option families together: branching text/Back, service explanations, 11-item overflow paging, locked choices, read-only diagnostics and regression contracts. Synthetic only; Blizzard continues to own live gossip, claims, services. Camera frozen. See P0265 evidence.

## Verified State
- **P0264 PUSHED / SCOPED FUNCTIONAL VISUAL PASS:** main `6b3ed96` verified; user reports preview reward card selections worked. `0.0.162-dev` export reports 8 choice clicks, `Quest Dialogue Check` and `Quest Offer Controls Check` PASS and native `probeCallOK=false`. Last `previewchoices state=inactive` follows Run All reset; no real choice/claim acceptance is implied. Historical P0264 R0 checker-version pin and R1 CURRENT_HANDOFF pointer errors remain recorded in P0264 evidence.
- **P0265 PREPARED / CLIENT UNVERIFIED:** one multi-function patch implements four realistic option preview scenarios through new shared option model/view/session, gated branching/Back, disabled entries, overflow paging, and F-tab diagnostics. No live gossip selection, stock suppression or camera changes.
- **P0263 PUSHED / SCOPED RUNTIME DIAGNOSTICS:** main `373c82b` verified; user's `0.0.161-dev` diagnostics show narrative/reward previews and offer/dialogue checks PASS. However no new functional UI was added, and user explicitly rejects repeated no-op regression loops. **N3 user-visible progression unsatisfactory, not accepted as meaningful capability.**
- **P0264 PREPARED / RUNTIME PENDING:** preview Multiple choice rows become clickable with an obvious exclusive SELECTED highlight, ability to switch choice, reset in Single/new narrative, inert completion feedback, and read-only counters in F panel. No live claim/choice ownership or camera changed.
- **P0262 PUSHED / SCOPED VISUAL PASS:** main `36d43f6` verified; five authored long/short/generic/Single/Multi previews worked and looked as expected. Paginator arrows and in-panel final-page controls visually accepted. The exported `0.0.160-dev` Quest Dialogue/Offer Controls/Run All checks report PASS; `lastResult=preview-only`, `probeCallOK=false`. This does NOT establish live claims, multi-choice, generic gossip or all camera transitions.
- **P0263 N3 PREPARED / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED:** cosmetic decision-button factory extracted; same two button objects and owner OnClick, same accepted quest/reward view, native recovery and camera unchanged. Full WSL shadow checker suite and in-client visual regression required.
- **P0261 PUSHED / SCOPED VISUAL PASS:** verified `main` `b439d4f`; user confirms previews work as expected. Does not establish live gossip, choice claiming, or unobserved quest transitions. P0261 earlier R0/R1/R2 checker/guard failures remain preserved in evidence.
- **P0260 PUSHED / SOURCE AUDIT COMPLETE:** GitHub `main` `1251434` verified; 54 provisional NPC interaction variants and coupled UI boundaries mapped. No runtime changes; camera preserved. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0260_MODULARITY_SOURCE_AUDIT.md`.
- **P0261 N1 PREPARED / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED:** source-independent narrative/decision presentation model maps guarded live offer and authored long/short/generic fixtures to the same production `QuestDialogue:PresentText` renderer. Two new P-tab buttons. Preview controls inert, generic gossip not live-integrated.
- **P0258 PUSHED / PREVIEW VISUAL ACCEPTED (SCOPED):** `edec5eb`; user accepted Multiple reward preview, not real choice/claim. Earlier P0256 P-tab gallery and P0257 model/gallery work are pushed; universal element preview coverage remains incomplete.
- **Live NPC quest ownership remains bounded:** scoped Accept/Decline and no-choice completion control exist; player-triggered reward selection, full gossip, Continue and complex services are NOT accepted as Logres-owned. Maintain usable Blizzard controls and native restoration. Quest 237 is reserved.
- **OPEN / DEFERRED negative evidence:** P0257 R0 duplicated layout geometry and failed P0254 checker; R1 failed its own generated-source preview-model assertion; R2 corrected static checks. P0251 R2 immersion restore failed before R3 acceptance. P0248 preview failed due to a nil reward renderer method before P0249 repair. Reward item availability had intermittent failures. These results remain in their original evidence records; no new run reclassifies them as PASS.
- **OPEN runtime issues:** native Blizzard-frame flash during actual completion claim; real multi-choice/claim unverified; unspecified issues from the user's gameplay session remain DETAILS PENDING; quest 237 must not be completed solely to validate this patch.
- **FROZEN CAMERA:** existing camera/DynamicCam framing, transitions, event subscriptions, coexistence and zoom behavior are accepted and unchanged by P0261.

## Next Action
Apply P0265 only against pushed `6b3ed96` with shadow full-static suite. Deploy and use `/logres panel` P — Previews: **NPC Choices: Branching** (choose north-road, Back, long historical narrative + page arrows, final-page options); **NPC Choices: Services** (select vendor/trainer/inn/flight/repair/bank/auction sample then Back); **NPC Choices: Overflow** (11 options, Next/Previous page, select sign 11, Back retains page); **NPC Choices: Locked** (two disabled options, available option works). Switch to Reward Preview: Multiple and verify existing choice behavior; then F → Quest Dialogue Check for `npcoptions` and H → Quest Offer Controls Check. No actual NPC transaction; native gossip remains available. Capture diagnostics. Camera frozen.

## Success Criteria
One patch must provide FOUR interactive synthetic NPC scenarios, reusable selection view, branching/Back, locked affordances, independent option paging, long narrative final-page gating and read-only counters. No Blizzard gossip or quest claim action; no suppressed native service, unhandled secret reads, camera changes or polls. Static and runtime acceptance remain separate. Real gossip/service adapters and live reward claims remain OPEN pending evidence.

## Do Not Reopen Without New Evidence
Do not infer addon installation from one guessed filesystem path or the presence/absence of a Lua global alone. No hard QuestieDB dependency, package bundling, unknown CurseForge project ID, global quest ID scans on updates, guessed quest availability, invented coordinates or native pin scraping. Do not hide the Blizzard minimap, alter user-accepted waypoint/focused-quest bearings, or treat missing locations as PASS. Baked flavor must not be guessed from a Source-only indicator. Keep negative and deferred evidence explicit.
