## P0214 — Approved action asset family / bounded scaling policy (2026-10-15)

P0213 pushed as `18dee5f`; user found contrast fine but corrected the process: the twelve `docs/design/approved/` reference sheets are the **approved visual implementation contract**. P0214 candidate replaces only the five shared `Logres/Media/Action/` RGBA textures with sheet-03-derived default/hover/press/checked/flash art at existing size. Native icons/cooldowns, action routes/pet controls, 42px hitboxes, 5px gap, and D-045 v4 layout are untouched. No shadowing of native controls or speculative resizing. User permits limited size/placement adjustments **if actual in-client fidelity requires it**; such changes need separate geometry and click-surface proof. Latest P0213 `0.0.122-dev` loadCount 280 final Run All/Compass/Layout checks PASS in ordinary world; user visual `fine` is not full asset validation. P0214 remains WoW UNVERIFIED. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0214_APPROVED_ACTION_ASSET_FIDELITY.md`.

## P0213 — H.3 narrow compass contrast candidate (2026-10-15)

GitHub main `018ea0a` (P0212 including P0211) verified. Scope: Theme-driven brighter compass direction labels and dark, fixed pixel-offset FontString shadows; no change to compass texture, geometry, bearing, edge fade, manual waypoint, data source, action or pet state. P0202 screenshot reports faint labels/ticks over bright sky; this only addresses **labels**. 0.0.122-dev is a candidate requiring in-game visual and panel tests; do not label visual PASS from static source. Use Phase E Compass Check, Phase H H.2 Map Layout Check/Overlay, Phase 0 Run All; compare light and dark scenery. P0211 pet behavior remains accepted for tested paths, secure interactions/taint still deferred. Evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0213_H3_COMPASS_CONTRAST_EVIDENCE.md`.

## P0212 — Pet visibility accepted for tested paths; panel-first and established addon research (2026-10-15)

User-confirmed P0211 `0.0.121-dev` loadCount 279: no native PetFrame/PetActionBar on Immersion-ON reload, return on OFF, disappear on ON, no duplicate in observed combat. P0211 diagnostics show first-world `worldArmed=no` while probe unavailable and subsequent `firstArmEvent=pet-probe-armed`, `armed=true`, driver failures=0. Close tested pet duplication/reload **presentation** defect; secure clicks, autocast, PET STOCK interaction, fresh Edit Mode exit and taint checks remain unverified. Do not modify working pet driver absent new failure. **Development process:** panel actions are the default for runtime checks; Bartender4/Dominos plus exact Blizzard Forever APIs should be reviewed before custom secure action/UI engineering (references only, no dependency or wholesale copying). P0211 GitHub push had not been confirmed when this docs checkpoint was authored (latest observed `main` `4076d25` P0210). See `docs/memory/evidence/P0212_PET_ACCEPTANCE_AND_WORKFLOW.md`; H.3 approved art/interaction integration is next.

## P0211 — Native pet reload startup defect
**P0211 INITIAL PET RELOAD FAIL (2026-10-14; NEW CANDIDATE, RUNTIME UNTESTED):** Correction to P0210: user reports Blizzard PetFrame/PetActionBar **visible immediately after `/reload`** despite saved Immersion ON. Explicit Immersion OFF -> ON hides both (PASS, user-observed), native stock stays suppressed in observed combat (PASS, user-observed), and Edit Mode displays native controls (PASS, user-observed). Full stock clicks/autocast/taint and Edit Mode exit remain unverified. P0209 R8 diagnostic loadCount 278 has `armed=true nativeDriver=true activations=7 failures=0` only AFTER OFF->ON, not at initial reload: startup failure mechanism UNATTRIBUTED. P0211 0.0.121-dev adds two one-shot addon-owned readiness handoffs from secure probe Arm and pet interaction setup to the existing Reconcile, plus first-world/first-arm source diagnostics. No polling, native Show/Hide, native visibility inspection, combat protected mutation, or change to secure hide/show driver. Validate on fresh reload BEFORE any Immersion toggle; do not claim startup PASS from static check. Evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0211_PET_STARTUP_RECONCILIATION.md`.

## P0210 — Local worktree and bounded runtime-evidence reconciliation (2026-10-14)

**P0210 WORKTREE RECONCILIATION (2026-10-14; LOCAL, DOCS/IGNORE ONLY):** GitHub main is P0208 `f6b9a3a`; P0209 R8 `0.0.120-dev` remains uncommitted. User confirms Blizzard PetFrame/PetActionBar absent after initial Immersion-ON `/reload` and again after Immersion OFF -> ON: ordinary visible behavior observed. Combat, PET STOCK, Edit Mode, native secure interaction and taint remain UNVERIFIED by this report. Preserve prior pet failures and candidate source/checkers/evidence. P0210 ignores temporary patch extraction/Windows sidecars without deletion or staging. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0210_WORKTREE_RECONCILIATION.md`.

## P0209 R8 — Correct-direction immersive native pet policy (2026-10-14)

**P0209 R7 RUNTIME MECHANICS CONFIRMED BUT DESIGN REJECTED / R8 LOCAL CANDIDATE.** LoadCount 276: native bar moved on first ON, Logres controls disappeared on second ON, OFF reversed that handoff (`activations=1 restores=1 failures=0`), which inverted user-required UX. R8 reuses R2 client-observed secure state driver, but uses a constant `hide` for BOTH Blizzard PetFrame/PetActionBar and NEVER hides Logres secure pet buttons. Immersion OFF / PET STOCK release drivers; native Blizzard owner methods refresh after release. Runtime still UNVERIFIED, including unit frame driver, combat, interaction, Edit Mode and fallback; no commit/push. Prior P0209 R0-R7 and P0206/P0197 problems remain.

## P0209 R7 — Explicit staged native pet handoff (2026-10-14)

P0209 R7 LOCAL / MANUAL TWO-STEP NATIVE HANDOFF (2026-10-14): R6 0.0.118-dev loadCount 275 user-confirmed ON/OFF staging/restoration **PASS** (activations=1 restores=1 failures=0), with both native and Logres pet buttons retained in the ON visual. Interaction, combat, Edit Mode and native ownership still UNVERIFIED. R7 default-OFF candidate: first ON reproduces R6 staging without suppression; second ON (only outside combat, after explicit human visual inspection) calls existing addon-owned `PetActionExecutionProbe:HideProbe`; it never hides Blizzard buttons or invents a second action executor. OFF restores stock anchor and re-arms Logres. Repeat R5 visual disappearance is an explicit FAIL, not acceptance. Historical P0209 R0/R1 prewrite, R2 combat swap, R3/R4 activation, R5 visual and original R5 prewrite, and P0206/P0197 problems remain recorded. No commit/push. Evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0209_R7_TWO_STEP_HANDOFF_EVIDENCE.md`.

## P0209 R6 — Native anchor visibility isolation (2026-10-14)

P0209 R6 LOCAL / STAGED NATIVE VISIBILITY (2026-10-14): `0.0.117-dev` R5 R1 loadCount 274 activated ON (`requested=true armed=true activations=1`) and restored OFF (`restores=1`), but the user observed Logres pet buttons disappearing on ON and returning on OFF, with no native replacement visibly established. Source cause: R5 `Acquire()` called `probe.HideProbe` unconditionally after only `PetActionBar:SetPoint`. Blizzard native root has independent show policy. R6 (`0.0.118-dev`) retains the functional Logres cluster and allows rearm while attempting only out-of-combat native-bar anchor relocation. Default OFF; visibility proof and combat/click restoration UNVERIFIED. No commit/push; P0209/P0206/P0197 failures OPEN. Refer to `docs/memory/evidence/P0209_R6_NATIVE_ANCHOR_VISIBILITY_ISOLATION.md`.

## P0209 R5 — Initial Edit Mode nil state (2026-10-14)

**P0209 R5 local candidate / WOW UNVERIFIED (2026-10-14):** R4 (`0.0.116-dev`, loadCounts 272–273) **RUNTIME FAIL**: `petbardriver on` rejected `editmode-manager-state-invalid`, `activations=0`. Blizzard's verified `IsEditModeActive()` returns an uninitialized `nil` before the first Edit Mode entry; R4 misclassified it. R5 accepts only ordinary nonsecret initial `nil` as inactive, still rejects active/restricted/unknown states, and changes no pet-action ownership or combat logic. **R5 initial ZIP PREWRITE FAILED** before any tracked-file write: its generator wrongly required `docs/memory/investigations/ACTIVE.md` to start with `# `, despite the valid `## P0209 R4` heading inherited from R3/R4. This R5 R1 archive corrects that heading expectation with an exact R4 section anchor; runtime behavior is unchanged. P0209 R0/R1 static failures, R2 combat-swap failure, R3/R4 activation failures, and P0206/P0197 protected/combat defects remain recorded. No push. Evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0209_R5_EDITMODE_INITIAL_NIL_EVIDENCE.md`.

## P0209 R4 — Unloaded Edit Mode manager gate (2026-10-14)

**P0209 R4 local corrective / UNVERIFIED (2026-10-14):** P0209 R3 (`0.0.115-dev`, loadCounts 270–271) **RUNTIME FAIL — activation never armed**. Repeated `/logres petbardriver on` rejected `editmode-unavailable-or-active`, `requested=false armed=false activations=0`, including after `/reload` and outside combat. The guard required an initialized `EditModeManagerFrame`; that Blizzard_EditMode frame can be absent when the manager is not loaded, which also means its Edit Mode is not active. R4 treats ONLY an absent manager as inactive; a loaded manager still must explicitly and ordinarily report inactive. No native pet move has yet been runtime proven. Evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0209_R4_EDITMODE_GATE_EVIDENCE.md`. Keep P0209 R0/R1 static failures, R2 swap failure and P0206/P0197 failures OPEN. No push.

## P0209 R3 — Native secure pet-button reuse trial (2026-10-14)

P0209 R0 memory-health PREWRITE FAIL; R1 61/60 Lua upvalue PREWRITE FAIL; R2 applied and ran in WoW (`0.0.114-dev`, loadCount 269) but **RUNTIME FAIL for intended combat behavior**: pressing trial ON removed the Blizzard pet bar out of combat, then the `[combat] show; hide` native / `[combat] hide; show` Logres state drivers removed Logres pet actions and showed Blizzard's bar during combat. This was the authored reciprocal policy and contrary to user intent. No push. P0208 `f6b9a3a` remains the verified HEAD. P0197 combat duplicate remains OPEN. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0209_R3_NATIVE_REUSE_EVIDENCE.md`.

R3 (0.0.115-dev) is an **opt-in / default-OFF / runtime-UNVERIFIED** source-based native-button reuse trial. In the manner of Dominos, use Blizzard's own secure pet buttons, but unlike Dominos do **not** reparent secure children or hide their native ancestor. Instead move the intact stock `PetActionBar` to the existing Logres classPet layout anchor only out of combat, and hide the duplicate Logres pet-action probe. The native bar and buttons remain active through combat; no reciprocal driver and no stock Show/Hide. OFF, Immersion OFF, PET STOCK and Edit Mode enter attempt restoration of the original native anchor (captured and passed as opaque GetPoint(1) token). PetFrame remains fully Blizzard-owned. Existing 18 Phase H actions preserved. If a protected operation fails, retain native controls and mark RUNTIME FAIL; do not commit.

Sources reviewed: https://github.com/tullamods/dominos/blob/main/Dominos/bars/petBar.lua and https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Bartender4/blob/master/PetBar.lua . Native stock frame is deliberately **not** reparented or hidden; control of native anchor is a new out-of-combat experiment, unverified in Forever. Full native editing/restoration and any protected taint still require user runtime proof.

## P0209 — Reciprocal PetActionBar secure driver trial (2026-10-13)

P0209 R1 **PREWRITE FAIL / NO TRACKED WRITES**: `check_ui_ownership_audit_contract.py` rejected 61 captured locals in `handleCommand` (Forever cap 60). P0208 HEAD already uses 60; R1 added local `runPetBarDriverCheck` and missed the existing budget. R2 makes the diagnostic a `Logres` namespace method, reusing an existing captured local. R1 had no WoW runtime test. Full static and runtime validation remain separate.

R0 **PREWRITE FAIL / NO TRACKED WRITES**: generated `CURRENT.md` omitted required `## Verified State`; `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` omitted the mandatory `CURRENT.md` authority pointer. The full shadow suite stopped at `check_memory_health.py`. R1 repairs these source-generation failures; the secure driver remains UNVALIDATED in WoW.

P0208 pushed `f6b9a3a`; stock pet frame/action visible in user loadCount 268 screenshots, but redundant native controls persist with Immersion ON. Source audit proves native PetActionBar event-driven Show and existence of secure visibility driver, not safe coexistence in Edit Mode. P0209 opt-in session-only default-OFF driver candidate uses paired `[combat] show; hide` Blizzard native and `[combat] hide; show` Logres pet cluster; only out-of-combat registration/release, native first on release. Separate PetFrame remains stock. Repurpose existing 18-button Phase H trial slots; legacy P0206 reparent remains QUARANTINED. **STATIC CANDIDATE / RUNTIME UNVALIDATED**. Edit Mode while driver ON is not approved; turn OFF before edit. Preserve R0-R6 P0206, R0/R1 P0208 and P0197 negative evidence. `docs/memory/evidence/P0209_RECIPROCAL_PETBAR_DRIVER_CANDIDATE.md` is authority. No claim of full combat-duplicate resolution until tested.

## P0208 — Fail-open Blizzard pet unit and action stock ownership (2026-10-13)

P0207 is PUSHED on `main` `f080661b`. R6 0.0.112-dev remained UNCOMMITTED / NOT ACCEPTED: loadCount 265 showed `petFrame:folded petActions:stock` and the user reported intermittent missing native UI even with Immersion OFF. P0208 R0 falsely rejected unchanged P0207 PATCH_INDEX due to an outdated author blob pin; R1 validated the correct HEAD blob but failed its uppercase-only quarantine predicate; R2 checks the actual R6 Lua file hash and preserves both failures. P0208 `0.0.113-dev` now prevents **both** stock pet domains from being folded in NativeSurfaceReplacement; world PET dock clearly labels `PET STOCK` and triggers only a one-shot reconciliation; Phase H Native Access Check reports `petPolicy=stock/stock` and `petVisual=UNVERIFIED` (snapshot policy, not Blizzard screen proof). No protected native visibility inspection, stock Show/Hide, reparent, new hooks or polling added. Full runtime visual/interaction validation is PENDING; do not mark PASS from source or `uiownershipcheck`. Preserve all 18 Phase H actions, P0206 R0–R6 failures and P0197 combat duplicate as OPEN. Evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0208_PET_STOCK_FAIL_OPEN_EVIDENCE.md`.

## P0207 — Pet UI full ownership / restoration audit (2026-10-13)

Docs-only; LAST PUSHED main P0205 `79a8e230`, local uncommitted P0206 R6 `0.0.112-dev`. Latest loadCount 265 demonstrates **petFrame:folded** while **petActions:stock** and trial QUARANTINED; stock UI Ownership labels mean policy (`observed=not inspected`), not visible/clickable proof. User reports intermittent missing pet frames/ability bar despite Immersion OFF, temporary reappearance via Edit Mode/PET; no OFF-state native diagnostic. Exact Forever 70338 source: secure PetFrame belongs to PlayerFrame and has independent `UpdateShownState`; native PetActionBar is Edit Mode-owned, reacts to pet events. R6 did not release PetFrame; existing saved shown tokens can become stale. R0/R3/R4 delivery, R1 panel regression, R2 protected/restore, R5 and R6 native restore failures remain preserved. **Next**: narrow fail-open release of PetFrame plus existing PetActionBar stock-first, independently validate visually and with secure interaction, retain 18 Phase H actions. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0207_PET_UI_FULL_LIFECYCLE_AUDIT.md`. P0197 combat duplicate remains OPEN.

## P0206 R6 — stock PetActionBar fail-open safety (2026-10-11)

P0206 R5 runtime **FAIL**: `0.0.111-dev` loadCount 262 trial QUARANTINED/armed=false, but NativeSurfaceReplacement recorded `petActions:folded`, `folded=4`, `restores=0` at initial audit, with later `onShow=4 immediateRefolds=4`. User reported Blizzard pet bar still absent after Immersion OFF (no post-OFF native snapshot in diagnostics). The R5 correction disabled only the hidden-parent trial and left earlier stock fold active. R6 `0.0.112-dev` makes `Native:Ready("petActions")` return false, preserving Blizzard pet-action bar in both Immersion modes without new protected mutation. **RUNTIME UNTESTED / FAIL-OPEN CANDIDATE**; P0197 combat duplicate remains OPEN. Preserve R0 panel overflow, R1 rejected slash-only control, R2 protected/restoration failure, R3 version-pin failure, R4 missing payload, R5 restoration failure. Evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0206_R5_STOCK_PET_RESTORE_FAILURE.md`; patch `docs/memory/patches/P0206_R6_STOCK_PET_FAIL_OPEN.md`.

## P0206 R5 — quarantined pet restoration after R3 and R4 prewrite delivery failures (2026-10-11)

P0206 R2 `0.0.110-dev` loadCount 261 produced an observed **FAIL**: stock pet bar was suppressed during combat, but Immersion OFF did not restore functional Blizzard pet controls; BugCatcher displayed generic `ADDON_ACTION_PROTECTED` text (specific function/addon/stack unavailable). Native parent arm/disarm counters (2/2, failures 0) were not proof of restoration. **DO NOT COMMIT R2.** R3 failed PREWRITE at `check_checker_version_policy.py`: the candidate checker froze `0.0.111-dev`. R4 failed PREWRITE with `FileNotFoundError`: the baseline R2 checker was omitted from the archive while still required by `r2.NEW`. R5 (`0.0.111-dev`) quarantines the hidden-parent trial, restores the P0205 native pet-fold code, retains all 18 Phase H controls but explicitly blocks ON. Exact native frame reparenting is rejected pending supported secure proof. After deployment `/reload`, validate manual PET, Immersion OFF stock fallback and no protected-action errors in ordinary play before committing. The original P0197 combat duplicate remains OPEN. Canonical evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0206_R2_RUNTIME_FAILURE.md`; corrective record `docs/memory/patches/P0206_R3_CORRECTIVE_QUARANTINE.md`; R3 prewrite failure and correction `docs/memory/patches/P0206_R4_CHECKER_POLICY_REPAIR.md`; R4's failed payload and R5 correction `docs/memory/patches/P0206_R5_PAYLOAD_DEPENDENCY_REPAIR.md`.

## P0206 — opt-in pet-bar combat hidden-ancestor trial (2026-10-11)

GitHub P0205 baseline `79a8e230` verified. P0206 R0 failed prewrite (18 Phase H controls against 15 max); R1 slash-only workaround rejected by user because the panel is the required workflow. R2 retains all 18 Phase H controls in a six-row grid (3x6) and moves diagnostics down to prevent overlap. Candidate `0.0.110-dev` introduces a **DEFAULT-OFF, session-only** PetCombatCandidate trial, activated explicitly via `/logres petcombat on` when out of combat. After native pet-fold and secure Logres pet readiness, stock PetActionBar may be parented to a hidden addon-owned holder; PET open, Immersion OFF, candidate OFF, and lost readiness restore the captured parent (opaque token) outside combat. The existing P0197 OnShow counters and deferred recovery remain unchanged. Combat requests reject, no protected state inspection, no polling, no blanket state driver, no D-045 movement. **Source/planned checks only; in-game combat, PET interaction, fallback and Edit Mode behavior NOT YET VALIDATED.** Any restore error is a real FAIL. Pet bar duplicate remains OPEN / REPRODUCED until runtime proof. Canonical records: `docs/memory/patches/P0206_PET_COMBAT_CANDIDATE.md` and `docs/memory/evidence/P0206_RUNTIME_CANDIDATE_EVIDENCE.md`. NPC green name overlay, aura provenance, ObjectiveTracker flash and H.3 contrast remain separate OPEN items.

## P0205 — Exact Forever 70338 PetActionBar ownership source audit (2026-10-11)

P0204 verified pushed `566bb8b5`. Exact upstream `Gethe/wow-ui-source@943764493e6b16d63ded3ab304150d1f05e58b57` (`1.60.1.70338`) establishes Blizzard PetActionBar's pet-event `Show()`, interactive Edit Mode-owned `UIParent` root and secure visibility state-driver infrastructure. P0197 post-combat recovery PASS (one trace) but duplicate in combat remains FAIL/OPEN/REPRODUCED. Insecure combat Hide, periodic reassertion and blanket stock-driver takeover are rejected; a hidden-ancestor/reversible secure handoff is **source-plausible but not runtime proven** and must remain **default OFF** in any candidate, preserving manual PET access, stock fallback and precise restoration. Next: one capability-gated, reversible runtime prototype plus diagnostics; do not claim source-only runtime success. NPC label/quest overlap, ObjectiveTracker flash, target aura native ownership and H.3 contrast remain separate OPEN items. Source details: `docs/memory/evidence/P0205_FOREVER_PET_COMBAT_SOURCE_AUDIT.md`. **P0205 docs-only, Logres `0.0.109-dev` unchanged.**

## P0204 — P0197 combat deferral reproduced, post-combat recovery observed (2026-10-11)

P0203 pushed GitHub `main` `5c28c2df`. User's `0.0.109-dev` loadCount 260 trace: Phase H Native Access Check recorded `onShow=2 combatDeferred=1 immediateRefolds=1 recovered=0 awaiting=true` (native reconciliation deferred); later Phase 0 Run All recorded the same OnShow/deferral but `recovered=1 awaiting=false`, native pending=false, no errors. **P0197 post-combat recovery PASS in this one transition; combat dual Blizzard/Logres PetActionBar FAIL / OPEN / REPRODUCED.** Do not misread stored `petActions:folded` as stock visibility, and do not infer original native show event from `lastReconcile=PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED`. Next narrow technical task is source/API audit for secure combat-safe interaction ownership/fallback, with no combat-time protected Hide, broad hooks, polling or v4 anchor motion. NPC green overhead-label quest occlusion, target harmful icon provenance and ObjectiveTracker flash remain separately OPEN. Canonical evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0204_P0197_COMBAT_RECOVERY_2026-10-11.md`. P0204 docs-only; `0.0.109-dev` unchanged.

## P0203 — combat stock PetActionBar REPRODUCED; dialogue-label occlusion observed (2026-10-11)

Two user screenshots show an extra small stock pet-action row overlaying the larger Logres pet grid during combat, plus green NPC overhead label text across the authored quest parchment. The user explicitly identifies the smaller row as **Blizzard PetActionBar** and reports the bar **returns in combat**: P0197 symptom now **OPEN / REPRODUCED IN COMBAT**, not unreproduced. Existing P0197 `OnShow` handling defers native Hide while InCombatLockdown and offers post-combat recovery; exact current `OnShow` counters are not yet supplied. Visible target status icons also occur in this combat image but their secure/ordinary owner and 2-column packing are unproven; no native aura-fit PASS/FAIL. Quest label occlusion is visually confirmed, render owner unresolved. Next: Phase H Native Access Check while stock row visible and after leaving combat, with no reload, and save addon-owned `petbar-reshow` counters. No protected visibility reads, polling, forced combat, suppression of native controls, source alteration, or v4 position change. Docs-only `0.0.109-dev` unchanged. Evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0203_COMBAT_PET_DIALOGUE_EVIDENCE.md`.

## P0202 — H.3 screenshot visual review (2026-10-11)

The user-supplied 1907x1192 (16:10) ordinary screenshot shows the implemented top-center compass, upper-right Active Quest parchment, separate/native access dock, lower action/pet clusters, sparse pet/target percentage bars, bottom-center resource, and retained single authored player buff. No obvious action clipping or quest/dock overlap in this still. **Observed concerns:** the compass glyphs/ticks are faint on pale sky; many empty gilded action slots create considerable visual weight. These are polish candidates, not proven runtime failures or permission to change hitboxes/source/anchors. The image does not show naturally populated harmful aura icons, native tooltip/click or combat/restoration states; these are DEFERRED. P0197 pet reappearance and ObjectiveTracker flash remain OPEN. H.3 whole-sheet visual acceptance remains OPEN. Exact evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0202_H3_SCREENSHOT_VISUAL_EVIDENCE.md`. No Lua/TGA/layout changes; `0.0.109-dev` unchanged.

## P0201 — P0200 R1 bounded diagnostic acceptance; H.3 visual review still open (2026-10-11)

GitHub `main` `9776cf9` verifies P0200 R1 `0.0.109-dev`. Uploaded loadCount 256: Phase 0 Run All complete, Layout 19/29/0 and v4 13/13 measured, Status Aura Preview ON/OFF PASS with secure native harmful inactive during preview and active afterward, Native Access PASS and 35-row UI Ownership 17 PASS / 18 STOCK / 0 FAIL. No new runtime Lua/protected failure reported. Native harmful membership and populated multi-aura fit remain DEFERRED; no new full-screen screenshot or direct visual acceptance. PetActionBar OnShow=0 this session does not close prior intermittent duplication; ObjectiveTracker flash and combat/special-control deferrals remain OPEN. **No code/art changes in P0201.** R0 prewrite failed on an invalid 39-character `docs/ROADMAP.md` SHA pin; R1 corrected it against the verified GitHub 40-character blob before writes. Next: one coherent screen-level H.3 visual review; no speculative new polish. Canonical evidence: `docs/memory/evidence/P0201_P0200_H3_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE.md`.

## P0200 R1 — coordinated H.3 visual implementation CANDIDATE (2026-10-11)

Verified P0199 R1 GitHub `main` `7064ea88` (docs-only audit). P0200 R1 **runtime UNTESTED** (`0.0.109-dev` proposed) aligns native harmful 25px artwork/target two-column fit with the approved aura frame, strengthens percentage and target/ally name readability, and quiets the native-access dock while retaining all action/secure hooks. No approved v4 anchor change, no player helpful artwork replacement, no new stock UI suppression or secret-value access. R0 failed safely in the shadow stage: check_h2_unified_placement_contract.py still demanded the obsolete 18px literal; no tracked files were changed. R1 updates that checker to test H.2 anchor and H.3 grid geometry. In-client multi-effect density, screen contrast, dock click/restoration, Phase 0 Run All and Phase H checks are PENDING; missing natural populated states are DEFERRED. PetActionBar duplication and ObjectiveTracker flash remain OPEN / INTERMITTENT / UNREPRODUCED. See `docs/memory/patches/P0200_H3_VISUAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## P0199 — approved-sheet visual fidelity audit, H.3 planning (2026-10-11)

Verified P0198 GitHub push `ed6ca7b`, ordinary runtime remains `0.0.108-dev`. P0199 compares all twelve D-039 approved sheets, current `Logres/Media/Theme.lua`, TGA production media, concrete module render paths and user screenshot. **No runtime change.** `docs/design/H3_APPROVED_ART_RUNTIME_FIDELITY.md` distinguishes art translated vs partial state/source capability. Highest mismatch: native harmful aura 18px/2px and generic `UI-Quickslot2` border, vs approved sheet-04 visual language and existing 25px framed target status / 36px framed player buffs. Plan ONE integrated H.3 candidate for restricted-aura-safe art/fit, text/percentage contrast, and action/native-access hierarchy, with no layout or owner-policy change. P0197 intermittent pet bar and ObjectiveTracker flash remain open; special/pet/aura runtime gaps remain deferred. See `docs/memory/patches/P0199_H3_VISUAL_FIDELITY_CHECKPOINT.md`.

## P0198 — P0197 ordinary refolding observed; intermittent trigger still open (2026-10-11)

P0197 verified pushed on `main` `0a20eef`, version `0.0.108-dev`, loadCount 253. User did not see the duplicate pet bar. Four actual stock PetActionBar OnShow events were met by four immediate Logres refolds, no combat deferrals or deferred recoveries, no pending recovery, no native-surface error. Native Access PASS and Phase 0 Run All completed twice within observed scope; latest Layout 19/34/0. **Do not claim combat-recovery runtime PASS or permanent fix**: the prior duplicate stock bar remains OPEN / INTERMITTENT / UNREPRODUCED, cause unknown. Preserve event-driven counters, native PET access and protected fallbacks. Small target debuff icons join coordinated H.3 visual polish after H.2 observed-layout integration. See `docs/memory/patches/P0198_P0197_RUNTIME_OBSERVATION.md` and `docs/memory/evidence/P0197_PET_BAR_RESHOW_EVIDENCE.md`.

## P0197 — intermittent Blizzard PetActionBar duplication, post-combat recovery candidate (2026-10-11)

Verified P0196 R4 commit `c89692b`; user confirms target buffs and debuffs correct. Screenshot shows stock PetActionBar occasionally visible under Logres pet cluster, exact trigger unknown. Latest `0.0.107-dev` loadCount 251 `native-surfaces` reported `petActions:folded`, `pending=false`, `error=nil` despite user visual failure; this measures only addon-owned snapshot state, not stock frame visibility. Source of `NativeSurfaceReplacement.lua`: PetActionBar `OnShow` during combat sets pending without Hide; post-combat `Reconcile` calls `Fold` but its existing snapshot causes early success without re-hide. Blizzard PetActionBar also explicitly calls Show on PET_BAR_UPDATE, UNIT_PET, PET_UI_UPDATE, UPDATE_VEHICLE_ACTIONBAR. P0197 adds only event-verified deferred recovery and counters. Combat as trigger is INFERRED / UNREPRODUCED, not proven. No polling or blanket suppression. Runtime test OPEN; see `docs/memory/patches/P0197_PET_BAR_DEFERRED_RESHOW_RECOVERY.md` and `docs/memory/evidence/P0197_PET_BAR_RESHOW_EVIDENCE.md`.

# Roadmap Status

## P0196 R4 — target stock aura source gate, runtime OPEN

P0196 R4 is an **UNPUSHED RUNTIME CANDIDATE** addressing the R3 verified visual residual: the small Blizzard contextual target aura icon remains despite correct Logres player/target buffs. R3 `0.0.106-dev` loadCount 250 native-surfaces reported targetAuras:stock; Logres helpful and secure harmful lanes remain. Forever 1.60.1.70338 TargetFrameMixin:ConfigureAuraContainer source supports native 0/0 aura limits and restores, without the R1 forbidden OnShow hook. Existing pet/player buff replacement is untouched. TARGET opens the native aura container; Damage Meter and beta reporter unchanged. R1 visual/hook failure and R2 delivery failure remain recorded. Details: `docs/memory/patches/P0196_R4_TARGET_AURA_NATIVE_CONFIG.md` and `docs/memory/evidence/P0196_R4_TARGET_AURA_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE.md`. No R4 runtime PASS yet.


## P0196 R3 — corrective buff art regression candidate

P0196 R3 is the next **OPEN / RUNTIME UNTESTED** checkpoint after R1 visual/target-hook runtime FAIL and R2 pre-write memory-health FAIL. The original crafted `PlayerHelpfulAuras` art and old StatusAuras/native harmful sizing are restored; new native 18px helpful icons and override takeover removed. Pet secure replacement candidate retained. Stock BUFFS is manually accessible beyond four authored Logres slots. Target contextual aura suppression is DEFERRED because the R1 OnShow hook failed. Damage Meter and Issue Reporter untouched. See `docs/memory/patches/P0196_R2_BUFF_PRESENTATION_CORRECTION.md` and `docs/memory/evidence/P0196_R2_REGRESSION_EVIDENCE.md`. P0196 R1 and R2 were NOT pushed. R2 passed whitening/own contract and earlier repository checks, then `check_memory_health.py` rejected CURRENT_HANDOFF.md because it omitted CURRENT.md; no tracked R2 writes occurred. See `docs/memory/patches/P0196_R3_PREWRITE_MEMORY_REPAIR.md`.


As of 2026-10-11.

Current verified checkpoint: P0195 on `main` `9097f43`, `0.0.104-dev` unified v4 layout, user screenshot confirms overall authored composition with native duplication outstanding; test scope remains ordinary, special combat transitions deferred. P0196 R1 is untested; user rejected unpushed P0196 R0 native-retention audit. Never treat proposed source suppression as validated runtime proof.

## P0196 R1 — native pet, buff and target-aura replacement (runtime candidate)

P0195 is verified pushed at `9097f43`; user approves the overall H.2 composition but reports stock PetFrame, PetActionBar, player buffs and target aura duplication. Prior P0196 docs-only proposal was rejected/unpushed; do not treat it as durable. P0196 R1 adds capability-gated native replacement and on-demand PET / BUFFS / TARGET access. No assertion that full secure pet editing, all 24+/20+ auras or combat/special behavior is proven. Damage Meter and Issue Reporter unchanged. Runtime check and fresh screenshot required before push and advancing.

## P0195 — one coordinated screen-wide v4 placement/reflow (runtime candidate)

P0194 R3 is pushed at `f7a67bc`, with user-confirmed panel map and full-screen blue/gold geometry screenshot; loadCount 245 Layout Check 16/23/0, H2 13/13 measured and Run All PASS in ordinary scope. P0195 translates all v4 authored regions using centralized UIParent-percent anchors and necessary role-specific action/priority aura geometry, while preserving native secure fallback and retained extra actions. This is NOT runtime placement acceptance until screenshot, interaction and error validation. Historical failures and special environmental deferrals retained.

## P0194 R3 — dedicated Phase H map view (runtime candidate)

P0194 R2 slash-only screen overlay was rejected as a developer workflow. The Phase H grid already has fifteen actions; R3 adds an H.2 Map **subview** without displacing them, displaying all 13 D-045 blue approved envelopes and P0192 gold measured addon bounds with in-panel overlay controls, refresh and Layout Check. Earlier R0 user visual failure and R1 shadow-checker delivery failure remain negative evidence. R3 is NOT a placement or combat/collision acceptance. Next one in-game screenshot and integrated checks, then a single coordinated screen-wide geometry pass.

## P0194 R0 rejection / R1 unified in-game screen map

P0193 R2 `213c526` verified pushed. User reports P0194 R0 failed visual bottom-center placement, showing resource label near old action cluster. Failure recorded without inventing Lua root cause; no P0194 commit was pushed. User directs one complete viewport-based screen map, then one coordinated positioning pass instead of independent widget trials. R1 failed its pre-write shadow contract; no tracked writes. R2 adds an on-demand blue-approved/gold-actual overlay for all 13 P0191 v4 rectangles; no Logres or Blizzard UI geometry is moved. Require screenshot/Run All before the single whole-screen placement patch. H.2 not complete; special and native fallbacks untouched.

## P0193 — P0192 R1 real geometry acceptance (docs-only)

Verified P0192 R1 on `main` `3777620`; uploaded `0.0.102-dev` loadCount 242 shows Layout Check PASS (16 anchors/23 binds/0 fail), H.2 **13/13 measured, 0 missing/0 deferred**, and Phase 0 Run All completed with existing checks PASS in tested ordinary scope. Measured rectangles are **not** collision or v4-placement PASS. Primary 4x3, Utility 3x4, actual target/aura width conflicts and Quest/native-access top-right crowding remain calibration constraints; native harmful anonymous frames and Blizzard group/special fallbacks unmeasured. P0192 R0 prewrite anchor failure preserved; R1 succeeded. P0194 bounded runtime placement after P0193 push; H.3 later. Canonical `../evidence/P0193_H2_GEOMETRY_RUNTIME_2026-10-11.md`.

## P0191 — accepted H.2 screen-map design baseline (docs-only candidate)

User accepts v4 13 component envelopes in normalized top-left percentage coordinates, with Main/Secondary y=60.4 and right-offset symmetric enemy auras; precise authority: `docs/design/layout/SCREEN_MAP_V4.json`, D-045. Player Debuffs above bottom-center Resource, class/totems above left action bars. This is *design acceptance*, not live UI pixel sizing/collision validation. P0191 preparation remains unpushed until user verification. P0192 follows as real geometry translation, H.3 only after H.2. All native stock fallback/secure/secret constraints and historical failures retained.

## P0192 — bounded H.2 read-only geometry observation candidate

P0191 v4 design is **PUSHED / VERIFIED** at `57c3112`. P0192 candidate `0.0.102-dev` adds a 13-row addon-owned actual-frame geometry observation to the existing Phase H Layout Check. Primary 4x3 vs approved tall Main, Secondary/Utility 3x4, pet 5x2, native harmful/quest/fallback extents are explicit audit constraints. No anchor positions changed or Blizzard presentation sampled. Runtime measurement/visibility/collisions remain UNTESTED until WoW validation; P0193 positioning follows accepted measurement, H.3 later. Source audit in `../evidence/P0192_H2_GEOMETRY_AUDIT_2026-10-11.md`.

Historical checkpoint (P0168): P0168 R1 verified; subsequent P0170–P0184 milestones supersede this as current work.

## Active work stream

**Phase H.2 ACTIVE — P0189 automatic Main normal Immersion ON user/runtime acceptance established; H.1 ordinary scope closed, special states deferred.**

P0167 is verified on main at `f58bccfb` / `0.0.84-dev`; user-supplied runtime confirms Phase H Layout Check (13/15, zero errors) and Run All PASS. The user's correction supersedes the P0164 claim that H.1 was finished merely because P0165 hid Accept/Decline; already-existing D/C suppression is not new H.1 work.

P0168 candidate `0.0.85-dev` suppresses the remaining ordinary quest-offer **QuestFrame shell** while the validated Logres narrative/actions own that offer. It preserves QuestFrame lifecycle (no `Hide`, no `SetParent`), disables the full captured stock mouse subtree, and restores exact presentation/mouse state before Logres withdraws. All unsupported offer and quest states remain Blizzard-owned. Runtime validation is pending; no broad UI removal is claimed.

## Phase status

| Phase | State |
| --- | --- |
| 0 — Foundation | COMPLETE |
| A — Core State Engine | COMPLETE |
| B — Core HUD | COMPLETE |
| C — Action Interface | COMPLETE |
| D — Immersion Controller | COMPLETE |
| E — Compass and Navigation | COMPLETE |
| F — Quest Experience | COMPLETE |
| G — Cinematic Camera | COMPLETE — P0162 RUNTIME PASS; ENVIRONMENTAL DEFERRALS PRESERVED |
| H — Integration and Polish | ACTIVE — H.1 ordinary normal-screen accepted (special environmental deferrals preserved); H.2 authored geometry next, H.3 later |

## Phase G / G.5

P0160 R2 is durable at `ae75989b` / `0.0.79-dev`.

The normal-Taxi zoom gate now passes.

Outbound:
- start about `4.0096`;
- target/final `50`;
- 347 samples;
- 346 toward / 0 away;
- 0 switches;
- 2 rebases;
- failures=0.

Landing:
- start `50`;
- target `5`;
- final about `4.9806`;
- 158 samples;
- 156 toward / 1 away;
- 0 switches;
- 2 rebases;
- failures=0.

The user visually confirmed zoom-out during Taxi and return close after landing.

Classification:
**G.5 TAXI ZOOM CONVERGENCE CLOSED FOR OBSERVED SCOPE.**

The earlier P0117/P0159 landing failures remain preserved as historical evidence.

P0161 remains accepted for observed scope. P0162 reactive mouse-wheel zoom is runtime-accepted at `4628f49e` / `0.0.81-dev`; G.6 and Phase G are closed for claimed observed scope.

## Parallel approved visual translation

Accepted checkpoints:

- P0120 shared percentage/resource bar — core runtime + visual PASS; richer
  ornament deferred;
- P0121 cast-state cue — player cast PASS; target runtime proof deferred;
- P0122 Context-message primitive — runtime/preview path PASS; completion styling
  deferred;
- P0123 heading/manual-waypoint Compass — runtime + visual PASS;
- P0124 organic player-health tunnel — runtime + visual baseline accepted;
  whole-interface polish deferred;
- P0126 Active Quest one-focus presentation — runtime + visual PASS at
  `89b0c563` / `0.0.58-dev`; whole-interface polish deferred.

P0128 source audit:
**RESOLVED — API/source layer available; mutation capability not proven.**

P0129:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED + READ-ONLY RUNTIME PASS FOR OBSERVED OFFER/GOSSIP SCOPE** at
`e50676b9` / `0.0.59-dev`.

Progress/complete and other unobserved categories remain deferred. Mutation
function presence was proven without invocation.

P0130:
**RUNTIME + VISUAL PASS on `0.0.61-dev`** — bounded/paged offer narrative accepted;
initial immersion-restore failure preserved and corrected in R1.

P0131:
**ACCEPT + DECLINE CAPABILITY PASS** — Decline proven on `0.0.62-dev`; Accept proven
on corrected `0.0.63-dev` with matched `QUEST_ACCEPTED` after intermediate
`QUEST_FINISHED`.

P0132:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED + RUNTIME/CONTROL PASS; VISUAL ORDER CORRECTION REQUIRED** at
`671f9836` / `0.0.64-dev`.

Production Decline/Accept behavior passes and Blizzard fallback remains usable.
Manual review found the Logres horizontal order opposite Blizzard's simultaneous
fallback.

P0133:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — RUNTIME + VISUAL PASS** at `f2feead6` / `0.0.65-dev`.

Accept-left / Decline-right now matches Blizzard while the fallback remains
visible; preview/final-page behavior and integrated checks pass.

P0135:
**SOURCE + PRIORITY-POLICY LAYER RESOLVED — DOCS/SOURCE EVIDENCE ONLY.**

D-041 establishes the urgency/fallback policy and pins the exact Forever aura
source/secrecy contract. Production ownership remains unproven.

P0136:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — RUNTIME PROBE PASS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFERRALS** at
`ef769f6` / `0.0.66-dev`.

Ordinary populated player helpful data is proven. Player harmful populated data,
populated target data, and the runtime secret-skip branch remain DEFERRED.
Integrated checks pass.

P0137:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — RUNTIME + VISUAL PASS** at `2b578759` / `0.0.67-dev`.

The production player `HELPFUL|PLAYER` passive lane is accepted at real UI scale.
Player harmful/urgent and populated target aura categories remain environmental
deferrals; private/group aura ownership and stock suppression remain gated.

P0139:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — SOURCE + FALLBACK POLICY LAYER RESOLVED** at `b0122136`.

D-042 accepts a conditional accessible nameplate as the only world-anchor
candidate, preserves the current screen-space target fallback, restricts reaction
to ordinary runtime-proven state, and limits relative danger to trivial-target
de-emphasis without exact difficulty inspection.

P0140:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — RUNTIME PASS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ANCHOR/ATTACHMENT DEFERRAL** at
`f7e2c31d` / `0.0.68-dev`.

Safe no-nameplate fallback, ordinary friendly reaction, ordinary
`UnitIsTrivial=false`, zero probe failures/secret skips, and integrated `Run All`
are proven for the observed scope. No accessible target nameplate was observed, so
positive anchoring, behind-camera behavior, and hidden attachment remain deferred.
Production target placement remains screen-space.

P0142:
**SOURCE-CAPABILITY LAYER RESOLVED — DOCS/PRIMARY-SOURCE EVIDENCE ONLY.**

D-043 records the source/fallback policy. Tracking selection is multi-select;
individual tracked-result and service-instance positions are not exposed by the
audited public source surface. Current-map `C_AreaPoiInfo`, minimap view radius,
broader current navigation, and same-map geometry survive as runtime candidates.

P0143:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — RUNTIME PASS FOR OBSERVED READ-ONLY SOURCE SCOPE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFERRALS** at `b9b2f90b` / `0.0.69-dev`.

Current map/player position, map world size, minimap view radius, and 23/23
tracking selector rows were ordinary with zero secret skips/failures. Four tracking
selectors were independently active. The tested map had no AreaPOI rows and no
current/quest/user-waypoint destination, so those paths and actual destination
distance remain DEFERRED. Integrated `Run All` passed.

P0145 `60244841` / `0.0.70-dev` proves manual-waypoint same-map distance and
clear-state fallback.

P0147 `c274a9d1` / `0.0.71-dev` proves the live-radius band mechanics but fails
visual calibration because the original scale span is too subtle.

P0148 `6f381a77` / `0.0.72-dev` is runtime + visual PASS with stronger
`1.20 / 1.05 / 0.85 / 0.70` anchors. The user accepts this as the production
baseline; exact amplitude refinement is deferred to later polish.

Quest/current-navigation, AreaPOI/service, tracking-result, and stock minimap
boundaries remain unchanged.

P0149 resolves the class/pet/special-control source layer against pinned Forever
`1.60.1.70205` source and accepts D-044. Pet secure casting is the strongest
control candidate, but no stock class/pet/special suppression is authorized.
P0150 bounded read-only runtime proof is next.

P0150:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — RUNTIME PASS FOR OBSERVED READ-ONLY SCOPE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFERRALS** at `46e06295` / `0.0.73-dev`.

The corrected R3 probe passes with 22/22 expected events, required APIs present,
10 pet slots scanned / 7 occupied, one safely secret-skipped Warlock power value,
ordinary false special-mode flags, and zero failures. Separate integrated Run All
passes.

Stance/forms, active totems, DK runes, active special modes, and meaningful nonzero
class-resource presentation remain DEFERRED.

Client build `70235` has matching Forever source at
`a84e2b1b41d3d4137127c07e4da448aa3251d6f1`; it is the direct child of the
P0149 `70205` pin and changes only `version.txt`. The audited secure pet source
files are unchanged.

P0151:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — DOCS / RUNTIME-EVIDENCE CHECKPOINT** at `b62397b1`.

Records P0150 acceptance, 70235 source continuity, and opens P0152.

P0152:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — R12 RUNTIME + CONTROL + STATE-PRESENTATION PASS; FINAL VISUAL POLISH DEFERRED** at `00aef4a9` / `0.0.74-dev`.

The accepted pet-state diagnostic recognizes ten click-specific pet bindings, seven naturally readable/occupied slots, two active indicators, and one autocast indicator. Default-on arming succeeds, and the user confirmed the visible state treatment and pet button execution. Stock PetActionBar remains available; edit/reorder/bindings/suppression/PetFrame and other class/special ownership remain separately gated.

P0153:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — DOCS / EVIDENCE CHECKPOINT** at `7ad9be7e`.

Records P0152 acceptance and the initial world-entry camera timeout.

P0154:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — DIAGNOSTIC PASS; RUNTIME CAMERA FAILURE PRESERVED** at `40dec187` / `0.0.75-dev`.

The diagnostic captured `145` samples, observed range `0 -> 50`, final/max easing error `45`, and command counts `142` inward / `1` outward.

P0155:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — RUNTIME FAIL; REVERSAL PATH NOT EXERCISED** at `e9be312d` / `0.0.76-dev`.

The retest recorded camera `50 -> 50`, elapsed about `23.523s`, one sample, zero commands, and zero switches.

P0156:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — OBSERVED NORMAL WORLD-ENTRY RUNTIME PASS** at `e1be731b` / `0.0.77-dev`.

World start/current/final about `5.0795`, target `5`, targetReached=true, failures=0, secret=false, error=nil; separate Run All clean. `firstDelay=0`, `switches=0`.

P0157:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — DOCS / EVIDENCE + MEMORY-SCHEMA CHECKER HARDENING** at `328f1543`.

Records the P0156 pass, preserves two rolled-back delivery failures, hardens CURRENT heading validation, and returns Phase G.5 to the pending P0119 normal-Taxi landing proof.

P0158:
**INSTALLED / PUSHED — DOCS / ROADMAP SEQUENCING CHECKPOINT** at `27670624`.

Its high-level order remains:
Camera parity -> Phase H safe suppression/coexistence -> authored positions -> final polish.

## P0159 — captured-profile context + zoom parity

P0159 R1 is **INSTALLED / PUSHED** at
`8ddcf09844961adec7bc90621f0f5ca294f15aef`
on `0.0.78-dev`.

Observed runtime:
- ordinary Camera Profile Check PASS;
- separate Run All clean;
- profile secretSkips=0 / readFailures=0;
- Taxi target `50` PASS twice around `49.75597`;
- post-Taxi City `~49.75597 -> 5` FAIL at final zoom `0`;
- 97 samples / 80 switches / max absolute position error about `49.471`.

Classification:
profile/context and Taxi-entry behavior pass in observed scope; the shared bespoke zoom driver fails the destination transition.

## P0160 R2 — source-backed LibCamera zoom driver

P0160 R2 is **INSTALLED / PUSHED + RUNTIME PASS** at
`ae75989bc0acadf550bd26e39c9bc70acee3e46c`
on `0.0.79-dev`.

Base Camera Profile Check and separate Run All pass.

Normal Taxi:
- outbound `~4.0096 -> 50`, final `50`;
- landing `50 -> ~4.9806`;
- source rebase exercised twice in each direction;
- zero direction-switch oscillation;
- zero camera failures.

The user visually confirmed the expected zoom-out and landing return.

## P0161 — captured profile rotation/settings parity

**INSTALLED / PUSHED + RUNTIME PASS FOR OBSERVED TAXI/SETTINGS/SHOULDER SCOPE** at `2a959094` / `0.0.80-dev`.

Accepted evidence includes Taxi target `50`, continuous yaw `-20`, City landing return about `4.97-5.01`, rotate-back completion, City max-distance factor `1` with captured original factor `4`, and zero profile/camera secret/runtime failures.

## P0162 — reactive mouse-wheel zoom

**INSTALLED / PUSHED + RUNTIME PASS** at `4628f49e` / `0.0.81-dev`.

The bounded wheel gate passed with active/hooked `OutQuad`, final `wheel=36`, `quick=9`, `resets=2`, `native=4`, `corrections=15`, OFF/ON release/reacquire, user-confirmed native wheel while OFF, and zero hook conflicts/secrets/failures.

## P0163 — Phase G closure

P0163 records the P0162 pass, closes Phase G for claimed observed scope, preserves Teleport/NPC/Fishing/Gathering/unobserved-AFK environmental deferrals, and makes Phase H primary. No WoW runtime code changes or redeploy are required.


## P0164 — Phase H.1 stock-surface suppression audit

**AUDIT COMPLETE — DOCS/EVIDENCE ONLY; NO RUNTIME MUTATION.**

The ownership matrix confirms existing runtime-proven suppression for Quiet Mode passive chat/social presentation, selective Player and Target shells, and conditional stock Bar 2–3 replacement. It preserves stock minimap, Party/CompactPartyFrame, target aura/status and target-of-target, Main/Override/special action surfaces, PetActionBar/PetFrame, class/resource/special surfaces, full quest tracking/log, persistent XP, nameplates, and unsupported quest states.

Hide Anything-style product guidance plus source-backed MoveAny mechanics were reviewed. Logres adopts only per-surface snapshot/restore, appropriate alpha+mouse or hidden-parent mechanics, combat protection, and evidence-specific reconciliation; it does not adopt blanket hiding, polling, timer retry loops, or permanent parent locks.

P0165 is the selected first new suppression slice: stock quest-offer Accept/Decline controls only, after exact Forever source/lifecycle verification. The whole QuestFrame and all unsupported quest/gossip states remain Blizzard-owned.

## P0169 — screenshot-grounded Bar 4–5 and layout candidate (2026-10-08)

The verified P0168 main `b455e7cf` and user-confirmed ordinary quest-offer suppression do not establish whole-screen stock-UI completion. The current screenshot reveals significant native presentation still visible. This is negative integration evidence. P0169 candidate `0.0.86-dev` adds source-backed Bar 4/5 secure Logres clusters + reversible normal-bar suppression, extends layout anchors from 13 to 15, and calibrates five ordinary action clusters. Main/Override, PetActionBar/PetFrame, minimap, full tracker, permanent XP, micro-menu and other unsupported controls stay stock and accessible. H.1 is ACTIVE; runtime/manual visual PASS is required before checkpoint acceptance; H.2 final layout is not closed.

## P0170 — P0169 startup error and diagnostic correction (2026-10-08)

Verified GitHub main `74ff4156` / `0.0.86-dev` is P0169. Uploaded diagnostics reveal early Bar 4/5 source configuration unreadable with `requested=false applied=false` while `stockreplacecheck` incorrectly emitted PASS. Later `Run All` induced a preference reconciliation and the normal Bar 2–5 replacement, extra routing and layout reported PASS. The failure and the later success are both preserved, with clean-login still OPEN. P0170 candidate `0.0.87-dev` preserves requested state on transient unreadable settings, retries on specific Blizzard lifecycle events, preserves last-known cluster presentation, and makes stockreplacecheck require expected/applied agreement/no pending/error. No new native hiding; Phase H.1 remains ACTIVE. Runtime acceptance requires **first post-reload** panel check before any Run All or preference mutation.

## P0171 — corrected H.1 product objective and P0170 acceptance (2026-10-08)

GitHub main `95aaa593` / `0.0.87-dev` is verified. Uploaded post-login diagnostics show P0170 startup recovery PASS with `expected=true requested=true applied=true pending=false`, one deferral/one `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` retry, and accepted stock Bars 2–5 routing plus Layout Check 15/17. That is a **narrow fix**, not completed Blizzard UI replacement. Earlier P0169 startup false PASS and generated-patch failures remain negative evidence. The assistant repeatedly diverted the user's request into serial audit/one-surface work and incorrectly claimed that all working matches had been hidden; the screenshot and surviving Main/pet/minimap/quests/XP/menu disprove this. **H.1 ACTIVE**: next one coherent missing-replacements/on-demand-fallback/suppression and positioning checkpoint; one combined visual/interaction/restoration gate. Source-backed secure protection and fail-open rules remain mandatory. Canonical failure record: `../evidence/P0171_H1_SCOPE_AND_DELIVERY_FAILURES_2026-10-08.md`.

## P0172 — coordinated four-domain native access (2026-10-08)

Against verified P0171 `26fa1ef7`, P0172 candidate `0.0.88-dev` implements a compact anchored access dock for navigation, full objective tracking, progress/status and micro-menu/bags, with native root capture/hide/restore, combat deferral and diagnostic counters. User-visible navigation/quest/menu functions remain reachable on demand. Main and pet protected action/control bars remain native until safe coverage exists; their remaining work is part of the same OPEN H.1 integration objective. Static source findings are not a full-screen runtime pass. Test screenshot, click regions, Blizzard lifecycle, manual access, OFF/ON and combat before accepting.

### P0173 — primary stock ownership gate

P0172 is verified on GitHub main `3a5028c8` / `0.0.88-dev`. User confirms most stock presentation folded and dock buttons working; Main normal primary remains visible. The final Native Access diagnostic was post-manual-open (0 folded/4 open), not an independent folded-persistence proof. P0173 `0.0.89-dev` source-backed read-only Primary ownership diagnostic is the current runtime candidate: classify ordinary Main 12-button source, five secure mode flags, current Logres routing/page readiness, while leaving Main and special controls stock. Phase H.1 remains OPEN, with next product gate combat-safe Main special/edit fallback and visual integration. Do not mistake diagnostics-only PASS for suppression.

### P0174 — action interaction, native cast and tracker coexistence (2026-10-08)

P0173 verified at `f9c99685` / `0.0.89-dev`: Primary read-only normal ownership PASS, optional routing ON `candidate=true`, routing OFF stock restored, all four original native domains folded, Run All clean. New user-reported limitations: action drag rearrangement absent, native cast bars still displayed, intermittent quest tracker return, Logres actions/aura tooltips absent. P0174 `0.0.90-dev` combines source-backed drag/swap and hover tooltips with reversible CAST native-access domain and event-targeted objective/cast re-fold; runtime candidate, all newly changed behaviors untested. Qualitative cast glyphs do not replace cast duration, so native on-demand CAST access is mandatory. No Main secure suppression or H.1 closure.

### P0174 R1 — failed pre-write shadow memory check (2026-10-08)

P0174 R1 SHA-256 `91146e93ad9c01a297976da316327ffc5325ea149cdff4b39aaca2b14f808c8d` reached the shadow static checker suite, then failed at `check_memory_health.py`: the generated `docs/memory/CURRENT.md` contained zero `## Success Criteria` and zero `## Relevant References` headings. User provided full terminal output proving this failure. R1 refused before tracked writes; the user's P0174 local changes remained in place. R1 is SUPERSEDED by P0174 R2; do not stage/reset/reapply R1. R2 restores canonical headings, validates the same combined candidate, and preserves the runtime issues as OPEN.

### P0174 R2 — tracker/cast native reappearance correction (2026-10-08)

P0174 `0.0.90-dev` was applied locally and its static manifest uploaded, but remote main remained P0173 `f9c99685`. First screenshot shows the native Objective Tracker visibly back over the native-access dock; user reports the tracker intermittently vanishes/reappears, while native player/target cast bars return in combat and Blizzard auras remain. The user's explicit report is negative runtime evidence, not a PASS. P0174's `Fold()`/`Refold()` policy holds an existing snapshot but event-only invalidation can miss later native `Show()` calls. R2 makes source-specific OnShow re-folds outside lockdown, preserving intentional manual dock opens and restoration, and adds accurate reappearance/combat-deferral counters. **No secure combat cast suppression is claimed.** Comprehensive player harmful/private and target aura visuals and suppression remain OPEN under D-041; no unsafe blanket aura hide. R2 runtime not yet tested. P0174 and R2 are one checkpoint, with no intervening Git push.

### P0174 R3 — combat cast visibility gate (2026-10-08)

The user tested P0174 R2 `0.0.90-dev`: the native Objective Tracker no longer reappears, accepted for the observed quest-update scope. **Native player/target cast/channel bars still reappear during combat.** Uploaded `LOGRES_DIAGNOSTICS_LATEST.lua` shows `nativeuicheck` 5 folded/0 open, source-specific tracker `onshow-refold`, `nativeShows=30/20`, `combatDeferred=2`, and `pending=0` after combat. The out-of-combat PASS does not prove combat-time native presentation. Remote main remains P0173 `f9c99685`; P0174 and R2/R3 are local, unpushed candidates. Preserve this negative evidence.

Pinned Forever Blizzard source `Gethe/wow-ui-source@15666a6e67938a1ab5caf041406464251db111ca` (`Blizzard_UIPanels_Game/Shared/CastingBarFrame.lua`, `Blizzard_UnitFrame/Mainline/TargetFrame.lua`) implements `CastingBarMixin:ShouldShowCastBar()` through `self.showCastbar` and offers `SetAndUpdateShowCastbar(showCastbar)`. R3 arms each of the three exact P0174 native cast sources' native show policy **out of combat**, before folding them; captures original flags only as opaque restoration tokens; and restores them through Blizzard's own setter when CAST is manually opened, Immersion turns OFF, or the module is disabled. No SetCVar, combat-time Hide/alpha, secure-handler snippets, reparenting, global hooks, or polling. If the setter is unavailable or fails, no cast folding authorization is granted, and stock remains the fallback. Native `OnShow` during combat while armed is recorded as a persistent escape, not a PASS after release. The existing CAST access dock is the explicit opt-in native casting-detail fallback (open before combat if exact progress is needed); Logres's production cast cue remains symbolic-only. Special-mode and combat-time CAST toggle are not claimed complete; full D-041 enemy/player aura replacement remains OPEN. Runtime validation of the new gate is PENDING; a source-backed hypothesis is not a PASS.

## P0175 — additive priority status lanes (2026-10-08)

Remote main verified at `996f6099` / `0.0.90-dev`, completing combined P0174/R2/R3 as a user-accepted observed runtime checkpoint. The post-R3 diagnostic records native access 5 folded/0 open, `castGate=true/true`, `gateEscapes=0`, integrated PASS. Earlier R1 shadow memory failure and R2 combat reappearance stay preserved as negative results. P0175 `0.0.91-dev` is an untested candidate providing real additive player urgent and target harmful/helpful priority aura icon lanes near authored screen-space fallback with native hover inspection and static preview. It does not hide stock auras, own private/group auras, prove world target attachment, or close H.1. D-041 and D-042 remain gates. In-game visual, natural source and safety tests required before acceptance.

### P0175 R1 — panel validation and target helpful coverage correction (2026-10-08)

The first P0175 delivery omitted the Status Aura Check/Preview controls from the developer panel despite panel-centric established validation; this was an integration failure. User also reports no visible enemy buff/debuff icons; P0175 source lacked an unqualified target `HELPFUL` fallback, while whether naturally populated enemy status was available remains unverified. R1 registers Status Aura Check, Preview ON, Preview OFF in Phase H and relocates the unchanged three pet-action execution probe buttons to Phase C (both phases stay within 15 buttons). It adds a general target `HELPFUL` fallback after urgent/priority target filters and distinguishes preview, populated live evidence, and environmental deferral in the status diagnostic. Blizzard aura frames remain stock, with D-041/D-042 gates unchanged. R1 is a corrective candidate until in-game validation; do not count static preview as populated runtime coverage.
### P0175 R2 — target debuff separation and loot flash (2026-10-08)

The user saw buffs on player and enemy but no debuffs after R1, plus one short quest-frame flash while looting. Runtime diagnostics proved preview icons (`2/3`) but did not prove populated live harmful data (player empty, target absent). A five-icon shared enemy status capacity could allow helpful effects to crowd out harmful effects. R2 splits target helpful/harmful into independent event-driven rows with separate category diagnostics, retains the existing player harmful row, source secret preflights, Blizzard aura fallback and Phase H status panel controls. It records the brief loot-associated Objective Tracker flash as OPEN / INTERMITTENT / UNREPRODUCED, not fixed by repeating Hide or polling; targeted cause and live harmful proof remain next acceptance gates. No blanket native aura or tracker suppression is authorized.

### P0175 R3 — preference-transition resource-bar regression (2026-10-08)

R2 failed in WoW: Phase 0 Run All stopped after Sensor Check with `StatusAuras.lua:273: attempt to index local 'rows' (a nil value)`, and persisted `immersionEnabled=false` hid the Logres mana resource bar. The R2 disabled aura snapshot omitted target `harmfulRows` / `helpfulRows` while the renderer always indexed those tables. P0175 R3 adds empty row tables on this disabled path and a new regression checker, retains player/target status visual features and Blizzard aura fallback. Runtime proof pending; no push. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0175_R3_PREFS_RESOURCE_RESTORE_2026-10-08.md`.

### P0176 — event-latched aura evidence and R3 runtime acceptance (2026-10-08)

P0175 R3 is now verified on `main` at `c55b6d7` / `0.0.91-dev`. Latest in-client `checkall` reached completion: Preference/Lifecycle/HUD and Status Aura checks passed; saved Immersion ON and HUD `visible=true`; no repeated nil-rows error. This closes R2's diagnosed Run All failure within its observed scope without erasing that failure. Live harmful samples remained empty/target absent and are DEFERRED, not PASS; brief looting quest flash remains OPEN/INTERMITTENT. P0176 `0.0.92-dev` is an untested read-only, event-latched per-category evidence candidate exposed in the existing Phase H Status Aura Check. Native aura fallback and all secure/protected boundaries remain unchanged.

### P0176 R1 — prewrite checker-compatibility correction (2026-10-08)

The original P0176 applier FAILED SAFELY before tracked writes after `check_status_aura_disabled_contract.py` could no longer isolate the disabled snapshot. The live-history instrumentation had been inserted within the active `elseif` branch. This prewrite failure is preserved, not counted as a WoW test or a successful patch. R1 moves the history call after the completed snapshot branch, gated on active/non-preview state, without modifying the R3 regression checker, rendering or aura sources. R1 requires fresh full-suite and WoW validation; original P0176 is superseded.

### P0177 — Independent Logres aura-source engine comparison (2026-10-08)

P0176 R1 is verified on main at `5379a9f` (`0.0.92-dev`). Runtime loadCount 224 confirmed two clean Run All completions and preview-excluded history; target helpful max=1 / positiveReads=4, player/target harmful max=0, final aggregate 456 secret skips across 53 scans (not unique auras), no source failures. Harmful-source capability is still DEFERRED. A source audit of WeakAuras (AuraUtil enumeration/trigger pipeline) and Plater (helpful/harmful separation, slot enumeration) informs P0177's *independently written* source engine, but their full code and restricted-source read strategies are not copied. Candidate `0.0.93-dev` adds a strictly read-only, per-index secret-preflight comparison of canonical HARMFUL/HELPFUL versus priority filters through the existing Phase H Status Aura Check. Preview and unsupported/absent targets defer; production renderers, stock aura coverage, native cast gate and quest native access remain unchanged. No renderer promotion or live harmful PASS until in-client evidence. The loot quest-tracker flash remains OPEN/INTERMITTENT.

### P0177 R1 — Recover uncommitted source files (2026-10-09)

The user pushed P0177 but GitHub `main` at `a2eed84` contains only the 12 modified tracked files: the TOC and Commands refer to a source engine not present on GitHub. The new `AuraSourceEngine.lua`, checker, patch/evidence and manifest were omitted. This is a real durability failure, not an in-game failure: client loadCount 225 at `0.0.93-dev` ran the local reader and completed Run All. Source compare observed target HELPFUL base ordinary=1 vs priority=0; HARMFUL remained empty/secret-restricted and hostile-only target proof remains deferred. P0177 R1 reconstructs missing files from the original ZIP and updates memory; no runtime logic changes. Verify the complete new-file set in the next user push before advancing. Loot quest flash and primary secure ownership remain open.

## P0178 — permanent Blizzard/Logres UI ownership checker (2026-10-09)

After GitHub verified P0177 R1 at `0f3f0b7`, the user requested a **flag-aware, expandable whole-interface** checker instead of repeated single-domain diagnostics, explicitly noting existing diagnostics already cover most behavior. P0178 adds a centrally registered, read-only inventory of Blizzard surfaces and Logres replacement/fallback (including deliberately stock domains), and displays the matrix in Phase 0 plus Run All. It consumes existing module debug snapshots; no new direct Blizzard presentation reads, polling or frame mutation. Classifications are PASS/FAIL/DEFERRED/STOCK; STOCK means intended retained fallback, not empirically verified visibility. Existing harmful-source limits, primary secure action fallback, and loot ObjectiveTracker flash remain open. Candidate `0.0.94-dev` requires full static and WoW validation before acceptance.

## P0178 R1 — Lua command-dispatch startup regression (2026-10-09)

Original P0178 `0.0.94-dev` failed in-client: `/logres` unavailable and another addon recorded `Commands.lua:4921: function at line 4566 has more than 60 upvalues`. Cause: added locally captured `runUIOwnershipCheck` exceeded Forever Lua's handler upvalue limit. The static checker and mock tests had missed whole-file compatibility. Preserve this as FAIL. Corrective R1 candidate `0.0.95-dev` dispatches via already-captured `Logres:RunUIOwnershipCheck()` instead, enhances the permanent audit checker to reject the local capture, and retains the same 35 ownership registrations. R1 requires exact-base/mixed-original-source validation, shadow static suite, deployment, `/reload`, restored `/logres`, UI Ownership Check, and Run All. This is a candidate, not runtime PASS. See `docs/memory/evidence/P0178_R1_SLASH_UPVALUE_FIX_2026-10-09.md`.

## P0179 — P0178 R1 verified ownership audit runtime (2026-10-09)

GitHub `main` `fd0dc88` contains corrected P0178 R1 `0.0.95-dev`. Uploaded loadCount 229 diagnostics confirm `/logres` registered, Phase 0 `uiownershipcheck` and Run All completed in Immersion ON and OFF (and ON again), plus lifecycle/preference PASS. Ownership matrix: ON **35 total / 17 PASS / 18 STOCK / 0 FAIL / 0 DEFERRED**; OFF **35 total / 16 PASS / 19 STOCK / 0 FAIL / 0 DEFERRED**. Five native fold domains and cast gate matched expected ON/OFF states; observed HUD visibility and player/target/chat/secondary action ownership cohered. `STOCK` means deliberately retained ownership and often `not inspected`, **not** verified Blizzard-frame visibility or replacement completeness. The original P0178 `0.0.94-dev` compile failure (`handleCommand` >60 upvalues; `/logres` absent) is still FAIL history; R1 fixes the observed startup regression.

The UI ownership registry must expand with future Logres UI ownership changes; existing specialized checks and Run All remain active. No new code or native suppression in P0179. Phase H.1 remains OPEN: naturally populated player/target harmful aura live/visual evidence still deferred, hostile-target buff classification unknown, loot-linked ObjectiveTracker flash intermittent/unreproduced, and primary/special/pet/party/minimap/full-quest stock coverage capability-gated. Canonical evidence `docs/memory/evidence/P0179_ACCEPT_P0178_R1_RUNTIME_2026-10-09.md`.

## P0180 — event-driven harmful-aura evidence checkpoint (2026-10-09)

GitHub `main` verified at `8f5d94f`: P0179 docs-only runtime acceptance durable; P0178 R1 `0.0.95-dev` UI ownership registry is an accepted ongoing regression gate (35 surfaces; Immersion ON 17/18 PASS/STOCK, OFF 16/19, zero FAIL for observed checks). P0180 candidate `0.0.96-dev` adds event-latched canonical-versus-priority aura *diagnostic* via existing `StatusAuras` events, with ordinary-safe friendly/attackable/unknown target classification. Preview and Immersion OFF excluded. No new renderer ownership, native mutation or polling; no harmful-aura runtime proof claimed. Stock fallback remains. Original P0178 >60-upvalue startup FAIL remains historical. Loot ObjectiveTracker flash remains intermittent/unreproduced and primary/special action ownership remains incomplete.

## P0181 — P0180 runtime acceptance and panel-only workflow correction (2026-10-09)

GitHub `main` `d45097c` contains P0180 (`0.0.96-dev`). User-uploaded `LOGRES_DIAGNOSTICS_LATEST.lua`, loadCount 232, has a complete Phase 0 **Run All** with no recorded Lua/command errors, and the 35-row UI Ownership summary ON **17 PASS / 18 STOCK / 0 FAIL / 0 DEFERRED**. Event history correctly distinguishes ordinary-empty, restricted, and one friendly-target HELPFUL general-filter candidate: prior P0180 session samples playerHarmful 2 empty, targetHarmful 9 with 6 restricted (8 hostile-classified/1 friendly), targetHelpful 9 with 1 ordinary positive on a friendly target and 6 restricted. No ordinary hostile target HELPFUL positive or player/target HARMFUL positive was proven. Restriction skips are not hidden-aura counts. P0180 is accepted **only for its observed diagnostic and regression scope**, with Blizzard aura fallbacks preserved; Phase H.1 remains OPEN.

**Process failure:** the assistant repeatedly gave slash commands despite the user requiring the developer panel and treated a not-yet-persisted Run All result as if the user had not run the test, wasting a duplicate test/reload. Correct future practice: use actual Phase 0 **Run All / UI Ownership Check**, Phase H **Status Aura Check/Preview** buttons; never demand repeated testing merely because an older SavedVariables snapshot lacks the run. P0181 changes documentation only. Historical P0178 >60-upvalue crash, P0175 R2 nil-rows, intermittent loot ObjectiveTracker flash, incomplete Main/special secure ownership, pet/party/class/minimap/full-quest/auras remain explicitly open as applicable. After P0181 acceptance, prioritize targeted Main/Override/special-action ownership capability review, not another generic aura scan.

## P0182 — restore target nameplate-only debuff filter coverage (2026-10-09)

Verified `main` `2adce36` contains P0181; event-history diagnostics passed but real player/hostile-target debuffs remain unproven, and user reports missing debuff display. Code review identified one concrete production filtering omission: target `HARMFUL|PLAYER` and `HARMFUL` omit the API's `INCLUDE_NAME_PLATE_ONLY` flag, excluding a legitimate nameplate-only class of effects. P0182 candidate `0.0.97-dev` adds nameplate-inclusive target harmful descriptors ahead of the existing fallbacks (which are retained), with bounded existing source enumeration, secret-first index preflight, deduplication and separate harmful/helpful rendering unchanged. No new diagnostics, unrelated action-bar work, native suppression or gameplay PASS is claimed. Existing player harmful lane remains separate; it may have additional unproven issues. Future verification exclusively through Phase H Status Aura panel actions and Phase 0 Run All / UI Ownership Check. Live harmful rendering and protected restrictions remain DEFERRED until observed. The P0181 Main/Override next-step prioritization was a planning error and is superseded by this debuff-first task; action work remains OPEN for afterward.

## P0183 — native secure-rendered Logres debuffs (2026-10-09)

P0181 is verified on GitHub `main` `2adce36` / `0.0.96-dev`. The user reports **Blizzard debuffs visible but no Logres debuffs**; P0182 nameplate-only filter trial did not resolve that. Prior P0176–P0180 scans filtered restricted indexed harmful auras out *before* Logres icon creation; repeated diagnostics alone cannot provide a rendered debuff. Source inspection of pinned Forever `Blizzard_CustomAuraContainer` and Forever-compatible WeakAuras/Musca-Auras shows a separate native aura-rendering route: addon-owned `CustomAuraContainerTemplate` with native aura buttons. P0183 `0.0.98-dev` implements player and target native HARMFUL containers in Logres's semantic positions while preserving the existing preview and ordinary-read fallback, target helpful / player helpful, private/group/native stock auras, and 35-row ownership audit. Native readiness ≠ live icon proof; in-game visual/runtime acceptance remains PENDING. Phase H.1 stays on functioning debuffs; Main/special secure actions remain open later. Validation is via developer panel only. P0182 failed to establish visual debuff coverage and must not be declared an accepted fix.

## P0183 R1 — prewrite packaging failure, corrected

The first P0183 delivery failed before reading the Git baseline or writing tracked files: `P0183 PAYLOAD missing/corrupt __pycache__/P0182_APPLY.cpython-313.pyc`. The packaging manifest had included a development-only Python bytecode cache that was not shipped. This is an artifact-delivery FAIL, not a WoW runtime test and not a gameplay result. P0183 R1 rebuilds the payload hash list from an explicit allowlist of shipped source files, disables bytecode creation during its internal P0182 candidate import, and includes an archive/hash integrity smoke test. Source, native debuff design, candidate version and runtime acceptance gate are unchanged. The corrected archive must still pass its prewrite complete checker suite before any tracked change; actual Logres debuff visibility remains unproven until the in-game panel/visual gate.

## P0184 — P0183 R1 in-client debuffs accepted, polish deferred (2026-10-09)

P0183 R1 was pushed as `11a342b`, build `0.0.98-dev`. The user explicitly confirms visible **Logres debuffs**, not Blizzard-only. Uploaded loadCount 234 Phase 0 Run All and ownership audits finished: native debuff containers ready/active, 35-surface audit 17 PASS/18 STOCK/0 FAIL, no reported command errors. The ordinary Lua-indexed harmful reader's zero rows do not reflect native secure aura membership. Runtime + visual PASS is limited to the observed native rendering and checks, not every unit/mode, and **does not authorize native Blizzard aura suppression**. Keep player/target/private/group aura stock fallback. P0182 filter-only approach did not resolve visibility; original P0183 ZIP packaging failure was prewrite, corrected in R1. Defer native icon polish to the eventual integrated Phase H whole-screen visual work. Phase H.1 remains OPEN for secure Main/Override/special action control/editing/restoration and other stock-held capabilities. P0184 docs-only memory handoff awaits push; no WoW redeploy needed.

## P0185 — authoritative normal-screen Main-bar scope (2026-10-09)

Verified remote `main` `4e999b1` includes P0184 docs acceptance and visually confirmed P0183 R1 native debuffs (`0.0.98-dev`). Run All complete; 35-surface ON ownership **17 PASS/18 STOCK/0 FAIL**. The user identifies **only the normal Blizzard MainActionBar as the remaining unwanted persistent bar**. `STOCK` is intentional fallback policy, not a list of UI elements that must disappear. P0185 is **docs-only**; next H.1 change must implement safe Main normal-mode visual/mouse suppression *only when* Logres Primary route and editing/restoration fallback are proven, with all special controls fail-open to Blizzard. Prior “P0183 runtime pending”, “P0168 next” and “P0182 active” statements above are historical. H.2/H.3 visual work (including debuff polish) waits for capability-safe H.1 completion.

## P0187 — Main secure normal mode candidate (2026-10-09)

P0186 native source gate durable at `2421040`. P0187 adds session-only manual Main normal gate/secure Primary-to-stock mode delegation and fails open to native stock when released; exact normal visual/interactivity, edit/OFF, combat and special-mode behavior requires in-game proof. Do not mark H.1 complete or change permanent default from static findings. Phase H.2/H.3 deferred until H.1 acceptance.

## P0187 R0 in-client ON/OFF/ON failure and R1 correction (2026-10-09)

User evidence (`LOGRES_DIAGNOSTICS_LATEST.lua`, loadCount 236, `0.0.99-dev`): initial `mainreplace on` CANDIDATE (`applied=true`, activations 1); `mainreplace off` STOCK (`applied=false`, restorations 1); subsequent ON repeatedly FAILED with `MainReplacement.lua:200: secure normal mode gate not established` (`armed=true`, `applied=false`, activations 1, restores 1). OFF afterward reported stale FAIL despite native stock already restored. This establishes a **reproducible re-arm failure, NOT a failed first release**. No special/combat mode was tested; no Lua traceback outside the intentional secure-gate assertion appears in the supplied panel diagnostics. This is not a test that stock was physically clickable afterward.

Narrow inferred cause, supported by secure state-driver implementation: unregistering `state-logresmode` stops updates but retains the `normal` attribute. After OFF explicitly shows the reusable gate, re-registering the same `normal` value does not trigger `_onstate-logresmode`, so Main remains visible under the gate and the fail-open assertion at line 200 fires. R1 clears only its own secure handler `state-logresmode` attribute out of combat when releasing and immediately before re-registering. Original Main parent restoration precedes release reset; routing release remains after native restoration. Failed-ON rollback also clears the addon state. OFF clears a stale failed-ON diagnostic if stock is already released. R1 adds order-sensitive static checker assertions for re-arm safety, without polling/hooks/native attribute mutation.

R1 `0.0.100-dev` is an **untested corrective runtime candidate** against the **P0187-applied but uncommitted** checkout at `HEAD` `2421040`. It has no runtime PASS until panel ON → OFF → ON → OFF is repeated and normal native visibility/click, Primary keys, Immersion OFF and Edit Mode recover. Native special states remain environmentally DEFERRED unless naturally observed. The earlier R0 runtime failure remains durable negative evidence; do not classify H.1 complete until restoration re-test.


P0187 R1 delivery FAILED before writes: original checker SHA did not match the local checker. P0187 R2 delivers the same R1 code while accepting only AST-equivalent checker formatting drift, and preserves unrelated untracked files. Runtime PASS remains pending.

## P0215 — Approved percentage + Active Quest media candidate (2026-10-16)

P0214 pushed `1ae5948`; user observed coherent approved action frames and functioning button presses, with Action/Layout/Run All PASS in latest `0.0.123-dev` diagnostics loadCount 282. This is bounded P0214 visual acceptance, not universal hover/combat or protected proof. P0215 (runtime `0.0.124-dev`) derives 5 production TGA textures from approved sheets 02 and 10: one shared normal/compact percentage fill + diamond (resource/target/pet/ally/objective), and aged Active Quest panel/divider/glyph. No Lua behavior/Theme geometry/click/Blizzard/pet driver modification. New image hashes are guarded by the two existing canonical static contracts and a dedicated sheet-02/10 checker. **P0215 UNTESTED in WoW**, including dynamic panel sizing, text overlap and neutral-fill tint. Confirm in client before acceptance; retain any FAIL/DEFERRED result. Refer to `docs/memory/evidence/P0215_APPROVED_BAR_QUEST_MEDIA.md`.

### P0215 R0 PREWRITE FAIL / R1 corrective delivery

The original P0215 applier failed before tracked writes: `check_memory_health.py` rejected generated CURRENT.md, missing the three required headings `Success Criteria`, `Do Not Reopen Without New Evidence`, and `Relevant References`. User-reported `git status` showed only two unrelated/untracked PNG previews; original TGA source remained unmodified. **R1** corrects generated memory and asserts all seven heading contracts prewrite, preserves identical media payload. No WoW art or control PASS follows from fixing package delivery. Keep this negative result; see the P0215 evidence record.
